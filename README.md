# Minecraft Barter Simulator
Programs that can be used to simulate any number of Piglin Drops (Bartering) in Minecraft to check the probability of every item.
There are currently 2 programs which have 2 different loot tables:
- 1.16 to 1.16.1
- 1.16.2+

Enter the number of gold ingots thrown (total number of events) and then the program will give the details of every item dropped (%age chance, number of trades gotten)
