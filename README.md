# Minecraft Barter Simulator
These programs can be used to simulate Bartering from the famous game Minecraft, where an entity randomly drops certain items with certain probabilities, when a player throws "Gold Ingots" near the entity. 

You just need to enter the number of gold ingots to be thrown and the program will virtually throw the gold and collect data such as how many trades did each item get (not the number of items) as well as the percentage occurance of every item trade.

There are currently 2 programs which have 2 different loot tables from 2 different versions of the game:
- 1.16 to 1.16.1
- 1.16.2+
